# DesignPatterns
I intend to use the recommended Design Patterns using Decorator pattern to append new affinities - different types of farms, farm animals etc - I liked the student example in the videos for reference.
For building new farms I will use the recommended factory pattern.
Finally, for the overall simulation I intend to use the mediator pattern.
Because the patterns are new to me I don't want to waste time with one that doesnt fit so I will stick to the recommended guidlines for now.
